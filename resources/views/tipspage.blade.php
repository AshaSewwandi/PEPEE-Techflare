                    <p>Responsible pet ownership starts with regular visits to the veterinarian. <br> Given their shorter-than-human lifespan, your dog or cat should be getting <br>a checkup at least once or twice a year.Depending on your pet's vaccination <br>schedule,they may go more frequently when they're young, but establishing <br>and maintaining good pet health means keeping up with vet visits as they age.<br></p>

                    <p>Vaccinating your pets is a vital component of responsible pet care.Soon after <br> welcoming your new pet into your home, schedule an immunization appointment.  <br>During your first visit, the vet will set up an immunization schedule for your <br>little pup or kitten to protect them from illness and disease. Vaccinations for puppies<br> should happen early in your puppies first few weeks after you bring him home. </p>
                    <p>Talk to your vet at your first appointment, on when a good time to schedule that visit.<br>They help prevent diseases such as rabies, Lyme disease, and distemper. <br>Cats benefit from vaccines that prevent feline herpes virus, feline leukemia, <br>and rabies. If you've adopted an adult or senior animal, make sure <br>they are immunized, too. Vaccinations do need renewal and aren't just for young pets.<br></p>

          <p>Sterilizing your pet prevents a host of health problems, including complicated <br>pregnancies, and reduces the number of homeless animals. Spaying your kitty <br>(removing the uterus and ovaries) greatly reduces her risk for cervical cancer,<br> eliminates the risk of ovarian cancer, and prevents her from going <br>into "heat." That minimizes the chance that she'll stray from home in search of a partner,<br> and any nearby male cats will be less aggressive (and they won't spray to mark their territory,<br> something that benefits you and your furniture). <br></p>
          <p>Neutering your puppy helps alleviate aggression and roaming the neighborhood,<br> and will prevent him from getting testicular cancer. Because spaying or <br>neutering is surgery that requires general anesthesia, your pet will likely stay <br>overnight at the vet's office for at least one night for observation and recuperation.<br></p>

          <p>It's no secret that dogs and cats love to play, and it's an effective relationship-building<br> activity. Take stock of their toys. Are they safe? Be mindful of threadbare stuffed toys that<br> pose choking hazards and hard, sharp edges that could cause injury. Throw away and<br> replace playthings that are worn out. Making DIY cat toys and dog toys is a great, <br>inexpensive way to bring even more fun to pet parenting!nRemember, these tips aren't <br> applicablejust during pet holidays â€” make them part of your regular pet parenting role, and you and your pets will reap the benefits for a lifetime!</p>
