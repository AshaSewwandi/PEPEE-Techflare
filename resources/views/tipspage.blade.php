                    <p>Responsible pet ownership starts with regular visits to the veterinarian. <br> Given their shorter-than-human lifespan, your dog or cat should be getting <br>a checkup at least once or twice a year.Depending on your pet's vaccination <br>schedule,they may go more frequently when they're young, but establishing <br>and maintaining good pet health means keeping up with vet visits as they age.<br></p>

                    <p>Vaccinating your pets is a vital component of responsible pet care.Soon after <br> welcoming your new pet into your home, schedule an immunization appointment.  <br>During your first visit, the vet will set up an immunization schedule for your <br>little pup or kitten to protect them from illness and disease. Vaccinations for puppies<br> should happen early in your puppies first few weeks after you bring him home. </p>
                    <p>Talk to your vet at your first appointment, on when a good time to schedule that visit.<br>They help prevent diseases such as rabies, Lyme disease, and distemper. <br>Cats benefit from vaccines that prevent feline herpes virus, feline leukemia, <br>and rabies. If you've adopted an adult or senior animal, make sure <br>they are immunized, too. Vaccinations do need renewal and aren't just for young pets.<br></p>

          <p>Two connected elements of responsible pet ownership include providing animals<br>with fresh, cool water and healthy food at all times. The right pet food will<br> enrich your best buddy's life, providing them with the energy and nutrients they <br>need. With so many meal options to choose from, it can be daunting, <br>but you can become adept in no time by familiarizing yourself with important <br>ingredients and how they help your pup or kitty.<br>
          <p>When choosing the best cat food, look for a good balance of protein, carbs and <br>fats. These are important ingredients for dog food, too, as is plenty of fiber for<br> the digestive system. In addition to healthy ingredients, select a pet food <br>formula that is appropriate for your pet's age, health conditions and activity level, <br>and speak to your vet before switching your pet to a specialized food.
